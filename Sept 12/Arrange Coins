You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Handler corner cases
        if n==1 or n==0:
            return n
        
        # update the number of fully constructed staircase
        output = 0
        while n>output:
            output = output + 1
            n = n - output
        
        return output
